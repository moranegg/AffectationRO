    "description": "A java implementation for The Assignment Problem  a distributed system as a set of processors that can perform tasks (or processes) in parallel. We therefore consider a set of m processors, each equipped with a certain amount of random access memory (RAM).\\r\\n We associate a cost to pay to perform this task on this processor, and each pair of tasks is associated with a communication cost. The Assignment problem works on minimizing the cost and maximizing the  tasks performed.",
